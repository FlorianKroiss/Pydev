PyDev 7.6.0 Released

PyDev 7.6.0 Release Highlights
-------------------------------

* **Debugger improvements** (updated to pydevd 1.9.1).

	* **Variables are now grouped** (special/class/function/protected) -- note: it's possible to hide groups in the variables view menu dropdown.
	* When a launching a subprocess does not target a python executable, the original args are kept (so, quotes are no longer trimmed).
	* A step in which would skip code won't be reported in the return if it'd reach the same location.
	* The disassembled version of a frame may be shown if the sources are not available.
	* PySide2 is supported to recognize QThreads/event loop in interactive console.

* **Python 3.8 parsing fixes**

	* Properly parsing f-strings with named unicode character. i.e.: *f"\N{BULLET}"*.
	* Properly parsing f-strings formats using colon. i.e.: *f"{datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}"*.
	* Properly parsing f-strings with vars ending in equals. i.e.: *f'{y=}'*.
	* Properly parsing raw f-strings such as *rf"str"*.
	* Properly parsing iterable unpacking syntax. i.e.: *return lastname.upper(), \*members*.

* Support for the latest version of PyTest (which may resolve symlinks and changed the TerminalWriter import location).
* PyDev package explorer is a bit faster (cache source project paths for a project).
* Recognizing type comments for *self* attributes. i.e.: *#: :type self.var: MyClass*.
* Trailing commas properly recognized in automatic import.
