PyDev 5.5.0 Released

PyDev 5.5.0 Release Highlights
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) onwards.

    * PyDev 5.2.0 is the last release supporting Eclipse 4.5 (Mars).
    
* If you enjoy PyDev, you can help in keeping it supported through its Patreon crowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/fabioz.
    
* **Refactoring**

    * Fixed refactoring error when dealing with imports which have a continuation char inside the module name part. **#PyDev-712**

    * When extracting a method, decorators are properly considered for the new method position. **#PyDev-321**
    
* **Code completion**

    * When accessing enums, 'value' and 'name' are properly found. **#PyDev-591**
    
    * Code completion improved on method chaining. **#PyDev-636** and **#PyDev-583**

    * It's now possible to choose whether when a code-completion which adds a local import should add the import to the beginning of the function or the line above where it was requested.
    
        * It may be configured in the preferences (Preferences > PyDev > Editor > Code Completion > Put local imports on top of method?).
        
        * Default was changed to add it to the top of the method.
    
* **New actions**

    * **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+O** can be used to open the last hyperlink in the console that's currently open (it's now possible to jump directly to the error in some exception). **#PyDev-755**

    * **Ctrl+2,sw** switches the target and value in assign statements (may not work properly if more than one '=' is found in the line).
    
* **Debugger**

    * Fixed error when hovering over variable when debugging. **#PyDev-580**

* **Others**

    * Fixed issue in grammar parsing on nested async calls. **#PyDev-753**
    
    * Fixed issue grouping imports when an import has a continuation char inside the module part. **#PyDev 712**
