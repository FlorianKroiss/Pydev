PyDev 5.9.2 Release Highlights
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) onwards.

    * PyDev 5.2.0 is the last release supporting Eclipse 4.5 (Mars).

* **Debugger**

	* Integrated speedups for Python 3.6 which use the new Python hook which allows the debugger to add breakpoints through bytecode manipulation.
