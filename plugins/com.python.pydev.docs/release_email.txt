PyDev 12.0.0 Released

PyDev 12.0.0 Release Highlights
-------------------------------

* **Debugger**
	* **sys.monitoring** is now used in Python 3.12 (and it's **much** faster than any previous version).
	* A new setting was added in the **Preferences > PyDev > Debug** to debug **just my code** (meaning that when stepping it will just step into files under PyDev source folders).
	* Improved the step into function (activated with **Ctrl+Alt** then **Click function** to step into).
	* Support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 was dropped (only Python 3.8 onwards is now supported).

* **Ruff**
	* Ruff can now be used as a code formatter.
	* The latest ruff (**0.1.x**) is now supported (as it broke backward compatibility in its **0.1.0** version).

* **Code Analysis**
	* Fixes in semantic analysis to better determine if strings in annotations should be checked for symbols or not.

Note: **Only Python 3.8 onwards is now supported**
	* **Python 3.6** and **3.7** support is now **dropped** (please use **PyDev 11.0.3** if you still use it).
